This project was the team project in my Java programming course in college.

This program is designed to batch rename a list of files with certain formats.

Although the program was demoed successfully in the class, I have found there are some logic errors on batch rename logics. Since there is no undo feature, as of now **I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO USE THE PROGRAM TO DO ANY RENAME TASK.**

### Features
- Batch rename files and folders with [Prefix][serial numbers] format.
- Batch search and replace certain string in file and folder names.
- Batch move files and folders to another folder.
- Multi language support in UI
